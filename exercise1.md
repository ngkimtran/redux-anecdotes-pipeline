# Exercise 11.1

I have chosen Dart - Flutter as the language for discussion in this paragraph. For taking care of CI setup, Dart - Flutter uses Dart linter and flutter_lints package for linting; flutter_test library for testing; and Codemagic as a CI/CD building tool. To set up CI for automating the delivery of Flutter applications, there are many options besides Jenkins and Github Actions, including Codemagic, Bitrise, and Appcircle as all-in-one options; Cirrus, Travis, GitLab, and CircleCI for integrating fastlane with existing workflows. To determine if a setup is better in a self-hosted or cloud-based environment, one must consider at least these five things: hosting requirements, budget, features, community support, and return on investment. The critical question to ask yourself before choosing or exploring a CI/CD tool is 'What is your/your company's policy on hosting the application and data storage?'. The answer to this question will alternate the outcome significantly. Another key thing to consider is where you are planning to spend your CI/CD funds, so one should take the time to understand the cost of both self-hosted and cloud-based environments. CI/CD features are also a critical part of the evaluation, you would want a tool that makes the build, test, and deployment process adaptable and straightforward. And because the CI/CD tool is a part of your ever-growing application, choosing one with excellent documentation that stays up-to-date is the wisest thing to do. One last thing is that CI/CD investment has a lot of value it can bring to a development team, so everyone should be practicing CI/CD.
